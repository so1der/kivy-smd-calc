<h1><b>Kivy SMD Resistors Calculator</b></h1>
So I rewrite my previous(https://github.com/so1der/smd-resistors-calc) version of SMD Resistors Calculator. Now it's using Kivy instead of Tkinter. Thats gave me an opportunity to use Buildozer and compile an APK file. With which I am not satisfied alas, its size is 12 Mb, and ~51 Mb after installation. Thats a little to much for a simple calculator app I guess :)
Anyway, you still can download this APK file, or compile it thyself. I am also slightly rewrited code for Buildozer, modified .py file is on the "calc_apk"
 folder.
